    "summary": "Attention mechanisms have been widely applied in the Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) task, as they help to focus on the area-of-interest of both\nvisual and textual information. To answer the questions correctly, the model\nneeds to selectively target different areas of an image, which suggests that an\nattention-based model may benefit from an explicit attention supervision. In\nthis work, we aim to address the problem of adding attention supervision to VQA\nmodels. Since there is a lack of human attention data, we first propose a Human\nAttention Network (HAN) to generate human-like attention maps, training on a\nrecently released dataset called Human ATtention Dataset (VQA-HAT). Then, we\napply the pre-trained HAN on the VQA v2.0 dataset to automatically produce the\nhuman-like attention maps for all image-question pairs. The generated\nhuman-like attention map dataset for the VQA v2.0 dataset is named as\nHuman-Like ATtention (HLAT) dataset. Finally, we apply human-like attention\nsupervision to an attention-based VQA model. The experiments show that adding\nhuman-like supervision yields a more accurate attention together with a better\nperformance, showing a promising future for human-like attention supervision in\nVQA.",

    "summary": "The attention module is the key component in Transformers. While the global\nattention mechanism offers high expressiveness, its excessive computational\ncost restricts its applicability in various scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose a novel attention paradigm, Agent Attention, to strike a favorable\nbalance between computational efficiency and representation power.\nSpecifically, the Agent Attention, denoted as a quadruple $(Q, A, K, V)$,\nintroduces an additional set of agent tokens $A$ into the conventional\nattention module. The agent tokens first act as the agent for the query tokens\n$Q$ to aggregate information from $K$ and $V$, and then broadcast the\ninformation back to $Q$. Given the number of agent tokens can be designed to be\nmuch smaller than the number of query tokens, the agent attention is\nsignificantly more efficient than the widely adopted Softmax attention, while\npreserving global context modelling capability. Interestingly, we show that the\nproposed agent attention is equivalent to a generalized form of linear\nattention. Therefore, agent attention seamlessly integrates the powerful\nSoftmax attention and the highly efficient linear attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of agent attention with various\nvision Transformers and across diverse vision tasks, including image\nclassification, object detection, semantic segmentation and image generation.\nNotably, agent attention has shown remarkable performance in high-resolution\nscenarios, owning to its linear attention nature. For instance, when applied to\nStable Diffusion, our agent attention accelerates generation and substantially\nenhances image generation quality without any additional training.
